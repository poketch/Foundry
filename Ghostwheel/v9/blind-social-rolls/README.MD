# Usage

World Script to make certain social rolls always be blind regardless of player settings.

To use simply add the script to your world as a world script.
The `World Scripter` Macro WILL work in this case.


# Choosing Which Skills

By default the macro applies to all Perception, Investigation and Insight checks.

The script can be edited to include other skills by editing the `always_blind` array, shown in the picture, to include the abbreviations (found in the table provided) of the desired skills following the format that is established already.
