# Description

When a character reaches 0 hit points under this variant, their maximum hp is reduced by a number equal to twice their level until they finish a long rest, they immediately regain all their hit points, and gain the dying condition.

# Usage

The included item is plug and play. Once an acor is at 0 hit point, rolling the wounded item will give them negative tempmaxhp and heal them to their *new* full.
