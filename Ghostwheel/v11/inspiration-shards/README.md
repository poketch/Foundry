# Description

Whenever a player succeeds on an ability or skill check outside of combat, they gain an inspiration shard. Once they have gained five inspiration shards, they gain inspiration as though they had been given it by the DM. A given player cannot gain inspiration while they already have it, or give their inspiration to other characters.
