# Healing

This is an item macro to make the item always heal on hit. 

## Usage

Copy the code from `item-healing.js` as an ItemMacro on the desired item then:

 - Change the healing to the desired amount maintaining the quotations around it. Usable syntax is the same as the `/r` command [https://foundryvtt.com/article/dice/] 

 - Add `ItemMacro` to `OnUseMacros` with the trigger `Before Active Effects`

 - ???

 - Profit


An example Item, `Dagger (test)`, is provided just in case.
