# Steely Resolve

### Description
By 2nd level, your supreme dedication and intense focus allow you to temporarily set aside the pain and hindering effects of injuries. When an opponent strikes you, the injury does not immediately affect you. You have a delayed damage pool that allows you to forestall the effects of many injuries. This pool begins at 0 with each encounter. When you take damage, you may add it to your delayed damage pool instead of reducing your hit points. At the end of each turn, you take damage equal to the total stored in your delayed damage pool (without any resistance affecting the damage there), which then resets to 0.

Any healing you receive can either increase your current hit point total as normal or reduce the total damage in your delayed damage pool. When you receive healing, you choose whether it affects your damage pool, your hit points, or both (you can split the amount of healing as you wish). Most crusaders opt to keep as much damage in their delayed damage pool as possible to maximize the benefit of their furious counterstrike ability (see above).
Special effects tied to an attack, such as conditions, still affect you as normal, and their effects are not delayed by this ability. For example, if you are bitten by a venomous spider, you must still attempt a Constitution save against the poison immediately, even though any damage incurred shifts into your delayed damage pool. In the same way, any other special attack that imposes a condition, such as a medusaâ€™s petrifying gaze, takes immediate effect on you.

At 2nd level, your delayed damage pool can hold up to 10 points of damage. Any damage beyond that comes off your hit points as normal. The maximum damage your pool holds increases according to the Steely Resolve in the Crusader table.

Damage taken from the Steely Resolve pool does not provoke a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on spells, but the DC when damage is taken is not reduced by damage entering your Steely Resolve pool. Furthermore, if you go unconscious due to dropping to 0 hit points, your steely resolve pool immediately drops to 0 without causing you additional harm.

### Usage 
Add the Feature to sheet and roll the item. It will apply two effects, one of them (usually the second) does nothing and can be deleted. Seems like this has to be a temporary effect.

# Aegis of the Sentinel

### Description 
Starting at 3rd level, you learn to defend yourself against the attacks of multiple creatures and still stand tall. At the end of any turn on which you have taken damage from an enemy, you gain an aegis on yourself which lasts until the start of your next turn. The aegis has a number of hit points equal to your crusader level, and whenever you take damage you may have the ward take damage instead. If the damage reduces the aegis to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage and the aegis disappears.

You do not gain the aegis if you already have a previous aegis affecting you.

### Usage 
Requires: [Effect Macro](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/effectmacro)
Add the Feature to sheet and roll the item. It will apply two effects, one of them (usually the second) does nothing and can be deleted.
