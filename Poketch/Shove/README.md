Knockback macro created by theripper93#3276

# Usage

Create a new global script macro and set it to `Execute as GM`, name it `Knockback` and paste the contents of `knockback_macro.js` into it.

NOTE: the name of the macro here is important and case sensitive.


Once the script is created the item itself is Plug and Play.
